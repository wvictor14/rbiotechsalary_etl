{% docs int_companies %}

This table contains information about each company. 

Companies can have disparate information because each respondent can give different answers for "Company Size", sectore, and private/public.

How do we consolidate information for each company?

- Most Selected
  - What if there's ties? Use most recent? 

What if there are inconsistencies in names?
