    description: >
      This seed file contains the mapping of raw job titles to standardized titles, along with their associated departments, hierarchies, and priority rankings. 
      The `keyword` column is used for matching against raw job titles in the source data, while `standardized_title`, `department`, and `hierarchy` provide the necessary information for categorizing and analyzing job positions.
    columns:
      - name: keyword
        description: "The keyword used for matching against raw job titles. This should be a lowercased version of the job title or a relevant substring."
      - name: standardized_title
        description: "The standardized job title that corresponds to the keyword. This is the official title assigned based on the highest-priority keyword match."
      - name: department
        description: "The functional area or job group associated with the response (e.g., Research, Operations, Commercial)."
      - name: hierarchy
        description: >
          The categorical level of the job title, which can be used for hierarchical analysis.
          Possible values include: C-Suite/Executive, Senior Management, Middle Management,
          Senior Individual Contributor, Scientific/Technical Professional, Associate/Assistant, Entry Level/Training, Specialized Role, Other.
      - name: priority
        description: >
          The ranking value used to resolve overlapping matches when a raw job title contains multiple keywords.
          A lower number indicates a higher priority (e.g., 1 is the highest priority). This allows for consistent assignment of standardized titles when multiple matches are possible.
